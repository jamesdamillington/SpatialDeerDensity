# Spatial Deer Density

**Reproducing analysis presented in Millington _et al._ (2010) for teaching.**

Analysis in the original paper was implemented in R (using a script). Files here implement the analysis in both R and Python (for comparison) using notebook format (better for teaching). Answers are provided in separate files (email james.millington[at]kcl.ac.uk for access). A metadata file is provided in the data directory (more details provided in the paper itself).

NB: [IRKernel](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) is needed to run R in Jupyter Notebook
